### This is a personal project, I use data collected from Vietnamese financial companies on their social networking sites.
### Method: I use Excel to analyze the insights contained therein, thereby providing meaningful suggestions to the performance team so they can carry out marketing campaigns in the most effective and optimal way.
### In addition, I also researched the trends of the Top 6 Vietnamese financial companies on how they market their companies in February 2024, thereby analyzing the directions of these companies to attract their customers.
